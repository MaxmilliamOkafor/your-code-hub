# Extension Icons

You need to add icon files to this folder:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create simple icons using any image editor, or use an online tool like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://www.canva.com/

For a quick start, you can use these placeholder SVG converted to PNG, or create your own with the AutoApply AI branding.

## Suggested Icon Design

A rocket emoji 🚀 or a stylized "A" logo with a gradient from purple (#8b5cf6) to indigo (#6366f1) would match the extension's branding.
