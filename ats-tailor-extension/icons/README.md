# ATS Tailor Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can copy the icons from the main chrome-extension/icons folder or create new ones.

## Quick Setup

Copy icons from the main extension:

```bash
cp ../chrome-extension/icons/*.png ./icons/
```

Or create new icons with a different design to distinguish this extension from the main QuantumHire extension.
